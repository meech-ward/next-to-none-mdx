# Setup Drizzle

Every time our application interacts with the database, it's going to use [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/overview). That means we're not really going to be writing SQL, instead we will write typescript. In this section we're going to go through the initial process of setting up Drizzle in a project so that we can query data from the database and display it on a page.


## Plan Schema 

It's pretty common to plan out the database schema using an ERD before we write any code. Here's a very basic ERD for our application that includes the tables for `users`, `posts`, and `media`. 

<Excalidraw id="B4BuNm9VO6gBPH8blmu2" />

<p></p>
<Note>
We're going to use `text` instead of `int`/`serial` as the data type for the users's `id`. This is going to make it easier to connect to a third party authentication provider later on. 
</Note>

## Define Schema 

Now we have some sense of what the entities are, how they relate to each other, and the data types we're using. The next step is to define the schema using Data Definition Language (DDL), that's when we write a bunch of `CREATE TABLE` statements and run them against the database. 

We're going to avoid writing raw SQL, and instead use TypeScript for everything. That means that any time we want to interact with the database, we're going to write TypeScript using the Drizzle library.

    Install the `drizzle-orm` library.

    Create a new folder called `db` in the `src` folder.

  <Instruction.Action step={3}>
    Create a new folder called `schema` in the `db` folder.

  <Instruction.Action step={4}>
    Create `users.ts`, `posts.ts`, and `media.ts` files in the `schema` folder.
  </Instruction.Action>
  <Instruction.Implementation>
    <Card>
      <FileTree focus={[{depth: 2, item: 2}, {depth: 3, item: 1}, {depth: 4, item: 1}, {depth: 4, item: 2}, {depth: 4, item: 3}]}>
      - src
        - app 
        - db
          - schema
            - users.ts
            - posts.ts
            - media.ts
      </FileTree>
    </Card>
  </Instruction.Implementation>
</Instruction>

It's up to us how we organize our code, Drizzle doesn't have an opinion on how we do this. We don't have to use a separate file for each entity, but this method makes sense and is easy to understand. Now we can define each of the tables within these files. 

### `users.ts`

<Instruction ratio="1">
  <Instruction.Action step={5}>
    Add the following code to the `users.ts` file.
  </Instruction.Action>
  <Instruction.Implementation>
  <CodeWithOutput>
    ```users.ts
    import { pgTable, text, varchar, timestamp } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core"

    export const users = pgTable("users", {
      id: text("id").primaryKey(),
      username: varchar("username", { length: 30 }).notNull().unique(),
      firstName: varchar("first_name", { length: 50 }).notNull(),
      lastName: varchar("last_name", { length: 50 }).notNull(),
      avatar: text("avatar").notNull(),
      createdAt: timestamp("created_at", { withTimezone: true }).notNull().defaultNow(),
    })
    ```
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "users" (
      "id" text PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
      "username" varchar(30) NOT NULL,
      "first_name" varchar(50) NOT NULL,
      "last_name" varchar(50) NOT NULL,
      "avatar" text NOT NULL,
      "created_at" timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,
      CONSTRAINT "users_username_unique" UNIQUE("username")
    );
    ```
    </CodeWithOutput>
  </Instruction.Implementation>
</Instruction>

The Drizzle TypeScript we've written here is kind of similar to SQL we would write to define the table, and you can click the <CodeButtonSVG.TopBottomFilledBottom inline /> button to see the SQL that Drizzle generates from this TypeScript. We never really have to think about `CREATE` or `ALTER` statements though, we just define the schema in TypeScript and Drizzle takes care of everything else for us.

Let's break down the drizzle code a bit.


<SideBySide ratio="2:3">
Use the `pgTable` function to define a Postgres table. The first argument is the name of the table as it will appear in postgres, and the second argument is an object that defines the columns. 

```ts
import { pgTable } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core"
const users = pgTable("users", {
  // All columns here
})
```
</SideBySide>

<SideBySide ratio="1:1">
<SideBySideBlock>
Drizzle provides a set of functions that map to PostgreSQL column types. 

These need to be imported from `drizzle-orm/pg-core`.
</SideBySideBlock>
```ts
// focus(2:4)
// focus(8:10)
import { 
  text, 
  varchar, 
  timestamp 
} from "drizzle-orm/pg-core"
```
</SideBySide>

<SideBySide ratio="3:5">
Use these functions to define each column as a property on the table object.

```ts
// focus(2:4)
export const users = pgTable("users", {
  id: text("id").primaryKey(),
  username: varchar("username", { length: 30 }),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at", { withTimezone: true }),
  // ...
})
```
</SideBySide>


<SideBySide center>
<SideBySideBlock>
Each of these functions takes two arguments:

1. The name of the column as it will appear in the PostgreSQL table.
2. An optional object that specifies additional column constraints or properties.
</SideBySideBlock>
```ts
// focus(2:3)
varchar(
  "username", // 1
  { length: 30 } // 2
)
```
</SideBySide>

<SideBySide>
Constraints and defaults can then be chained onto the end using methods like `.notNull()` and `default()`.
```ts
// focus(2:3)
timestamp("created_at", { withTimezone: true })
  .notNull()
  .defaultNow()
```
</SideBySide>


You might have noticed that we use camelCase for the property names in TypeScript  and snake_case for the column names in Postgres.

<Card center>
createdAt -> created_at

firstName -> first_name
</Card>

This is a common practice to adhere to the naming conventions of both languages. Drizzle takes care of mapping these for us.

<SideBySide ratio="1:1" width="normal">
```query.ts 
db.select().from(users)
  .where(eq(users.firstName, "Sam"))
```
```query.sql 
SELECT * FROM users 
WHERE users.first_name = 'Sam';
```
</SideBySide>

<Note>
The unique index on user.username is case sensitive. This means that "Sam" and "sam" are two different usernames. Make sure you handle this in your application however you see fit. For example, you could make the username lowercase before inserting it into the database.
</Note>

### `media.ts`

<Instruction ratio="1">
  <Instruction.Action step={6}>
    Add the following code to the `media.ts` file.
  </Instruction.Action>
  <Instruction.Implementation>
    <CodeWithOutput>
    ```media.ts
    import { serial, text, integer, pgTable, pgEnum, timestamp } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core"

    export const mediaType = pgEnum("media_type", ["image", "video"])

    export const media = pgTable("media", {
      id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
      type: mediaType("type").notNull(),
      url: text("url").notNull(),
      width: integer("width").notNull(),
      height: integer("height").notNull(),
      createdAt: timestamp("created_at", { withTimezone: true }).notNull().defaultNow(),
    })
    ```
    ```sql
      CREATE TYPE "media_type" AS ENUM('image', 'video');

      CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "media" (
        "id" serial PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
        "type" "media_type" NOT NULL,
        "url" text NOT NULL,
        "width" integer NOT NULL,
        "height" integer NOT NULL,
        "created_at" timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now() NOT NULL
      );
      ```
    </CodeWithOutput>
  </Instruction.Implementation>
</Instruction>

<SideBySide ratio="3:5">
`pgEnum` is used to define a [Postgres enum](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-enum.html).
Then we can use it just like any other type.
```ts
// focus(1:1)
// focus(5:5)
const mediaType = pgEnum("media_type", ["image", "video"])

const media = pgTable("media", {
  id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
  type: mediaType("type").notNull(),
  // ...
})
```
</SideBySide>

### `posts.ts`

<Instruction ratio="1">
  <Instruction.Action step={7}>
    Add the following code to the `posts.ts` file.
  </Instruction.Action>
  <Instruction.Implementation>
    <CodeWithOutput>
    ```posts.ts
    import { serial, text, timestamp, integer, pgTable, AnyPgColumn } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core"
    import { users } from "./users"
    import { media } from "./media"

    export const posts = pgTable("posts", {
      id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
      userId: text("user_id").notNull().references(() => users.id),
      mediaId: integer("media_id").references(() => media.id),
      replyId: integer("reply_id").references((): AnyPgColumn => posts.id),
      content: text("content").notNull(),
      createdAt: timestamp("created_at", { withTimezone: true }).notNull().defaultNow(),
    })
    ```
    ```sql
      CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "posts" (
        "id" serial PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
        "user_id" text NOT NULL,
        "media_id" integer,
        "reply_id" integer,
        "content" text NOT NULL,
        "created_at" timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now() NOT NULL
      );
      ALTER TABLE "posts" ADD CONSTRAINT "posts_user_id_users_id_fk" FOREIGN KEY ("user_id") REFERENCES "users"("id") ON DELETE no action ON UPDATE no action;
      ALTER TABLE "posts" ADD CONSTRAINT "posts_media_id_media_id_fk" FOREIGN KEY ("media_id") REFERENCES "media"("id") ON DELETE no action ON UPDATE no action;
      ALTER TABLE "posts" ADD CONSTRAINT "posts_reply_id_posts_id_fk" FOREIGN KEY ("reply_id") REFERENCES "posts"("id") ON DELETE no action ON UPDATE no action;
    ```
    </CodeWithOutput>
  </Instruction.Implementation>
</Instruction>

<SideBySide ratio="3:5">
`import` another table to reference it in the constaint.

Chaining a `references()` function will add a foreign key constraint.
```ts
// focus(1:2)
// focus(6:7)
import { users } from "./users"
import { media } from "./media"

export const posts = pgTable("posts", {
   id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
   userId: text("user_id").notNull().references(() => users.id),
   mediaId: integer("media_id").references(() => media.id),
   // ...
})
```
</SideBySide>

<SideBySide ratio="3:5">
A self-referencing foreign key constraint requires us to explicitly set the return type because of TypeScript limitations.
```ts 
integer("reply_id").references((): AnyPgColumn => posts.id),
```
</SideBySide>

### Column Types

You can see all of the [column types](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/column-types/pg) that are available for [schema decleration](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/sql-schema-declaration) in the [Drizzle docs](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/column-types/pg).

### Table TypeScript Types 

At some point it's going to be necessary to have TypeScript types that represent theses entities. You might already imagine a type for the users table that looks something like this:

```ts
type User = {
    id: string;
    username: string;
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    avatar: string;
    createdAt: Date;
}

```

Fortunatly for us, Drizzle has some convenient table model type inference properties that we can use: 

<SideBySide ratio="3:5">
`$inferSelect` will give us a type that represents the object we will receive when making a select statement.
<CodeWithOutput>
```users.ts
type User = typeof users.$inferSelect
```
```ts
// return type when queried
type User = {
  id: string;
  username: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  avatar: string;
  createdAt: Date;
};
```
</CodeWithOutput>
</SideBySide>
<SideBySide ratio="3:5">
`$inferInsert` will give us a type that represents the object we will insert into the table.
<CodeWithOutput>
```users.ts
type NewUser = typeof users.$inferInsert
```
```ts
// insert type
type NewUser = {
  id: string;
  username: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  avatar: string;
  createdAt?: Date | undefined;
};
```
</CodeWithOutput>
</SideBySide>

<Instruction>

<Instruction.Action step={8}>
  export the `User` and `NewUser` types from the `users.ts` file.
</Instruction.Action>
<Instruction.Action step={9}>
  Do this for the other tables as well.
</Instruction.Action>
<Instruction.Implementation>
```users.ts
// focus(7:8)
import { text, varchar, pgTable, timestamp } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core"

export const users = pgTable("users", {
  // ...
})

export type User = typeof users.$inferSelect
export type NewUser = typeof users.$inferInsert

```
</Instruction.Implementation>
</Instruction>

## Migrating/Pushing Schema

The schema is now defined for our three tables, that's great! We could even use these to start writing out some type safe queries in TypeScript, however, we should probably add these tables to our Neon database before we do anything else. That way we can actually add some data and run some queries. 

To run the schema against the database we can do one of two things:

* **Migrate**: Generate a migration, which creates sql files, then run those files against the database. 
* **Push**: Apply the shema directly to the database without creating migration files. 

Either way, we're going to need Drizzle Kit.

## Drizzle Kit

To run migrations, pushes, or do a bunch of other cool things, we can use the `drizzle-kit` library. 

```sh 
drizzle-kit push # Update Database Schema
drizzle-kit generate # Generate migration files from the database schema
drizzle-kit studio # Start Drizzle Studio
```

This is the CLI companion for Drizzle.

<Instruction ratio="1:1">
  <Instruction.Action step={10}>
    Install `drizzle-kit` as a dev dependancy.
  </Instruction.Action>
  
  <Instruction.Implementation>
    <Tabs>
      <Tab name='npm'>
        ```bash
        npm install -D drizzle-kit
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab name='pnpm'>
        ```bash
        pnpm add -D drizzle-kit
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab name='yarn'>
        ```bash
        yarn add -D drizzle-kit
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab name='bun'>
        ```bash
        bun add -D drizzle-kit
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Instruction.Implementation>
</Instruction>

All of the `drizzle-kit` commands use a `drizzle.config.ts` file in the root of the project. This file tells Drizzle Kit where to find the schema files, what database driver to use, and where to output the generated files.

<Instruction ratio="1:1">
  <Instruction.Action step={11}>
    Create a new `drizzle.config.ts` file in the root of your project (with all the other config files).
  </Instruction.Action>
  
  <Instruction.Implementation>
    <Card>
      <FileTree focus={[{depth: 1, item: 3}]}>
        - public
        - src 
        - drizzle.config.ts
        - next.config.js
        - ...
      </FileTree>
    </Card>
  </Instruction.Implementation>
</Instruction>

<Instruction>
  <Instruction.Action step={12}>
    Add the following code to the drizzle config file:
  </Instruction.Action>

  <Note>
    If you're using `bun`, you don't need to add the `dotenv` code.
  </Note>
  
  <Instruction.Implementation>
    ```drizzle.config.ts
    import { defineConfig } from "drizzle-kit"
    import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';

    dotenv.config({
      path: '.env.local',
    });

    export default defineConfig({
      schema: "./schema.ts",
      dialect: 'postgresql',
      dbCredentials: {
        url: process.env.MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL!,
      },
      verbose: true,
      strict: true,
      out: "./drizzle",
    })
    ```
  </Instruction.Implementation>
</Instruction>

Notice that we're using the `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` from the [neon roles](/neon-roles) section. This url will be used for migrations, pushes, and drizzle studio. 

We won't generate any migration files right now, but when we do, they will be generated in the `./drizzle` directory.

<Instruction>

  }
  ```
  </Instruction.Implementation>
</Instruction>

Now we're ready to start using Drizzle Kit!

### Migrate

If you're familiar with migrations already, then you already know how this works. 

Anytime you update the schema in one of those typescript files, you can generate a new migration which generates a new SQL file in the `./drizzle/migrations` directory. That SQL file will contain the SQL needed to update the database to match the schema in the typescript files. Then you can run the SQL file against your database to update it.

This is a really amazing feature for so many reasons, but we're going to ignore migrations for now. We will come back to this topic later, but for now there's a better option, pushing. 

<Note>
For more information on Migrations, you can take a look at the [Drizzle Kit quick start](https://orm.drizzle.team/kit-docs/quick). 
</Note>

### Push 

Running a migration creates a new SQL file that we have to run against the database. This is really great in production, but when we're rapidly prototyping it can be a bit of a pain to always be generating and running new SQL files for every little change we make to the database. So drizzle has a **push** feature to make prototyping and rapid development easier.

<Instruction >
  <Instruction.Action step={15}>
    Push the database schema to the database.
  </Instruction.Action>
  
  <Instruction.Implementation>
    <Tabs>
      <Tab name='npm'>
        ```bash
        npx drizzle-kit push
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab name='pnpm'>
        ```bash
        pnpx drizzle-kit push
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab name='yarn'>
        ```bash
        yarn dlx drizzle-kit push
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab name='bun'>
        ```bash
        bunx drizzle-kit push
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Instruction.Implementation>
</Instruction>

This will run the DDL, the `CREATE TABLE` statements, against the database and create the tables for us. You can verify this by checking out the **Tables** section in the Neon dashboard. Feel free to add some data to the tables while you're there. 

If we need to make a change to the schema, we can just update the TypeScript files and run `drizzle-kit push` again. Drizzle will handle the `ALTER TABLE` statements, we only need to worry about the structure of the schema.

## Drizzle Studio 

Drizzle Studio is a GUI for Drizzle. It's a really great tool for exploring your database and creating or updating data for testing.

<Instruction >
  <Instruction.Action step={16}>
    For Drizzle Studio to work with Postgres, we first need to install `pg`.
  </Instruction.Action>
  <Instruction.Implementation>

      <Tab name='pnpm'>
        ```bash
        pnpm add -D pg
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab name='yarn'>

        bun add -D pg
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Instruction.Implementation>
</Instruction>

<Instruction >
  <Instruction.Action step={17}>
    Run `drizzle-kit studio` to start Drizzle Studio.
  </Instruction.Action>
  
  <Instruction.Implementation>
    <Tabs>
      <Tab name='npm'>
        ```bash
        npx drizzle-kit studio
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab name='pnpm'>
        ```bash
        pnpx drizzle-kit studio
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab name='yarn'>
        ```bash
        yarn dlx drizzle-kit studio
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab name='bun'>
        ```bash
        bunx drizzle-kit studio
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Instruction.Implementation>
</Instruction>

It should start running on [http://127.0.0.1:4983](http://127.0.0.1:4983). Visit that URL in your browser and make sure the three tables exist there. 

<Instruction >
  <Instruction.Action step={18}>
    Create a new fake user for yourself. Here's a placeholder image for a user avatar: "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/?d=mp".

    Create a few posts for yourself. Remember that `user_id` and `content` are the only required fields that you **must** provide values for.
  </Instruction.Action>
</Instruction>

Feel free to add more data to the tables while you're there, just make sure you have at least one user and a few posts.

## Drizzle and Next

Good job making it this far. We have a database with tables in it, let's write some queries. 

Actually, first we need our next app to be able to connect to the database, then we can write and run queries. 

### Neon Serverless & Drizzle ORM

<Note>
These instructions assume that you will host your Next.js application in a serverless environment. Since Next.js is designed around serverless, I would recommend hosting your Next app on something like [vercel](https://vercel.com/solutions/nextjs), [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/with/nextjs/), or aws serverless using [sst](https://docs.sst.dev/start/nextjs). However, if you plan is to host your Next.js app on a "real" server, then follow the [drizzle postgres.js setup instructions](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/quick-postgresql/postgresjs) instead. This is according to the official [Neon nodejs docs](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/node).

So much information about the serverless driver and optomizations: https://neon.tech/docs/serverless/serverless-driver
</Note>


Drizzle is responsible for translating our TypeScript code into SQL and running it, but it doesn't actually connect to the database. We need to use a database driver to connect to the neon database, and we're going to use `@neondatabase/serverless`.

### Queries

All database interactions will happen through the `db` object. We just need to import the `db` object and any tables we want to query from, then we can run queries like this:

```ts
import { db } from '@/db'
import { users } from '@/db/schema/users'

const users = await db.select().from(users) // get all users
await db.insert(users).values({ name: 'Sam' }) // create a new user
await db.update(users).set({ name: 'saM' }).where(eq(users.name, "Sam")) // update a user
await db.delete(users).where(eq(users.name, 'saM')) // delete a user
```

You can read the [Drizzle Docs](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/select) docs to see more examples of queries.

## Async Components

Now let's use this on the home page where we display a list of posts.

<Instruction>
  <Instruction.Action step={22}>
    Update your `src/app/page.tsx` file to query the posts from the database.
  </Instruction.Action>
  <Instruction.Implementation>
```src/app/page.tsx 
import { db } from '@/db'
import { posts as postsTable } from '@/db/schema/posts'

export default async function Home() {
  const posts = await db.select().from(postsTable)

  console.log(posts)

  // ...
}
```
  </Instruction.Implementation>
</Instruction>

Notice that the component is now an `async` component. That's totally fine and normal. 

The posts coming back from the database don't contain any user or media information, so you might need to comment out some of your JSX to get this to run.

Run the app and navigate to the home page, if you check the server console, you should see an array of posts. It should look something like this:

```js
[
  {
    id: 1,
    userId: 'user-1',
    mediaId: null,
    replyId: null,
    content: 'This is a test post'
  },
  // ...
]
```

This is a great start, but we really need to be able to get the user and media information for each post, so we need to join the tables together...

{/* More about async components later, next up async components, then drizzle queries */}

Adjust the rest of your code to grab all posts from the real database instead of the fake one. Remember to add more data to the database using [Drizzle Studio](#drizzle-studio) so that you have more than one post to display.

Don't worry about creating or updating any data for now, just focus on reading data from the database. We'll come back to creating and updating data later.

Connection caching provides server-side connection pooling, so that a new connection does not have to be set up for each query over HTTP. You can enable it by setting fetchConnectionCache to true in the neonConfig object. */}
